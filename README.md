# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect email spam with high accuracy.
## Dataset

The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing a mix of spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Model

The project employs a machine learning model, likely a classifier such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), or a decision tree, to identify spam emails based on various email attributes.

## Accuracy

The model's performance is marked by high accuracy. It achieves an accuracy score of 97.70%, indicating its effectiveness in correctly classifying spam and non-spam emails.
